<center><h1><u>Regional Security Environment</u></center></h1>
 India occupies a pivotal geographical position in the Indian Ocean. An overwhelming large quantum of India’s external trade and more than 70 per cent of our energy imports originate in West Asia and pass through the Indian Ocean. Maritime Security figures as an important dimension of India’s bilateral relations with all Indian Ocean littoral states as well with several regional and multilateral bodies such as IORA, ADMM Plus, IONS, ReCAAP, ARF etc. India has made substantial progress in its maritime engagement in the region and beyond. We initiated
efforts to help maritime neighbours establish informationsharing networks and contribute to shared development of Maritime Domain Awareness. Maritime connectivity is one of the key pillars of India’s development cooperation with Asia and Africa. India has been working with likeminded countries to preserve the integrity, inviolability and security of the maritime domain. Recognizing the growing importance of maritime trade in an increasingly mglobalised world, India supports freedom of navigation and over-flight, and unimpeded commerce, based on the principles of international law, particularly UNCLOS.
The situation in India’s immediate neighbourhood remains complex. There has been a rise in terrorism in the Pakistan-Afghanistan region. In Sri Lanka and Nepal, the success of post conflict transition processes depend on the ability of the political system to evolve an inclusive agenda that accommodates the aspirations of all communities. The growing trend of countries in the region falling into debttraps through new paradigms of external developmental assistance poses a challenge to the long term stability of these relatively small and vulnerable economies. Such loans and assistance have already led to adverse consequences for some recipient countries. In Afghanistan, the emergence of ‘Islamic State’ and Taliban with the support of countries in the region and outside has further complicated the security situation and continued to foment terrorism and violence. The Afghan National Security Forces, with the help of US and NATO forces, continue to target Taliban and Islamic State to reduce their influence. The Taliban however continues to pursue distinct military as well as political objectives in Afghanistan. The newly announced US policy for Afghanistan and South Asia in August 2017 indicates more flexibility in conducting operations in Afghanistan. Pakistan
has yet to reign in its proxies operating in Afghanistan and sheltered in Pakistan.<br>
<h1><center><u>The internal security situation</u></center></h1> 
In Bangladesh has continued to improve due to the effective synergised operations being conducted by Bangladesh’s security forces. However, the danger of an increase in radicalisation remains a cause of concern that could impact on the internal security situation of Bangladesh with possible consequences for India. India and Bangladesh continue to progress bilateral defence cooperation. Historical ties, cultural linkages and security imperatives drive the two nations to enhance economic and defence cooperation for mutual benefit. The exodus of large number of people from Rakhine State of Myanmar since August 2017, largely to Bangladesh, has resulted in a humanitarian crisis in Bangladesh. State sponsored terrorism by Pakistan in Jammu and Kashmir remains the foremost internal security challenge faced by the country. Due to unrelenting efforts of our security forces, violence levels were considerably reduced in the state during the year, including incidents of stone pelting which saw a reduction of almost 55 percent. This has been the most successful year in the last five years for the security forces in terms of number of terrorists eliminated in the state. The Government appointed former Director of Intelligence Bureau, to initiate and carry forward a dialogue with elected representatives, various organizations and concerned individuals in Jammu and Kashmir.  There was a marked improvement in LWE Scenario in 2017. The geographical spread of LWE violence saw significant reduction with the number of districts reporting violence going down from 68 in 2016 to 58 in 2017. The improved security situation is a result of resolute implementation of the multi-pronged strategy encompassing security measures, development measures, ensuring rights and entitlements of local communities etc. Greater presence of security forces across LWE States and severe attrition on armed LWE cadres through arrests, surrenders, desertions and neutralization in operations
have contributed to the reduction in violence. Several developmental initiatives have been taken specifically for development of LWE affected areas including focused schemes for development of roads, setting up of mobile towers, skill development and financial inclusion etc. apart from the flagship schemes of Central Government in infrastructure, education, health, agriculture etc.  The overall security situation in the North Eastern states improved substantially in 2017. The numbers of insurgency related incidents in the region decreased by 36% percent compared to 2016 (2016-484, 2017-308). The year 2017 witnessed the lowest number of insurgency incidents since 1997. Security forces casualties in the region declined from 17 (2016) to 12 (2017) and civilian casualties from 48 (2016) to 37 (2017). Similarly, number of kidnapping/ abduction incidents also declined by 40% (2016-168, 2017- 102). Counter Interagency Operations led to neutralization of 57 militants, arrest of 995 and recovery of 432 weapons in 2017 in the region. Compared to 2013, insurgency incidents declined significantly by 58%, civilian’s casualties by 66%, SFs casualties by 34% and kidnapping/abduction cases by 67% in the region in 2017. While the States of Sikkim, Mizoram and Tripura had no insurgency related violence in 2017, insurgency/militancy related violence declined by 56% in Assam, 67% in Nagaland, 28% in Manipur and 59% in Meghalaya compared to 2016. In 2017, State of Manipur remained the most violent State accounting for about 54% of the total incidents in the region. There is increase in violent incidents by 22% in Arunachal Pradesh in 2017.
